## Notes for Implementation Planning

- Each cost component roughly maps to an implementation stream
- The cost structure validates that these are all **separate, identifiable work items** the Ministry expects
- AMC costs confirm the requirement for ongoing maintenance capabilities (monitoring, retraining, re-indexing)
- Training costs confirm the requirement for comprehensive training materials and sessions
